# AI Powered Dashboards â€” Tech Layoffs vs Hiring Trends (2022 to Present)
**THIS IS MOT A FINISHED PROJECT THIS MAY CHANGE IN FUTURE**
This project builds interactive dashboards to visualize and analyze trends in **tech industry layoffs vs. hiring** over the past few years. By fusing multiple data sources, we draw insights into market health, recovery, and sector-specific dynamics.

## ðŸ“Š Project Goal & Motivation

- Track how hiring and layoffs in the tech sector have evolved from 2022 onward  
- Enable stakeholders (job seekers, analysts, companies) to see patterns, downturns, and recoveries  
- Use AI / data analysis to highlight anomalies, ratios, growth rates, and predictive signals

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Dashboard / Web Framework**: (e.g. Streamlit / Dash / Flask) â€” *(replace with your actual framework)*  
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib / plotly / seaborn, scikit-learn (if used for modeling or insight extraction)  
- **Project Modules** (example namesâ€”replace with yours):  
  - `app.py` â€” runs the dashboard  
  - `data_fusion.py` â€” merges and processes datasets  
  - `insights.py` â€” computes derived metrics, anomalies, ratios  
  - `requirements.txt` â€” dependency list

## ðŸ§­ Methodology & Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Fusion**  
   - Gather datasets (e.g. tech job postings, layoff announcements, market reports)  
   - Clean, standardize, and merge into unified datasets  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Compute aggregate statistics: total hires, total layoffs, year-over-year shifts  
   - Plot timelines, correlations, heatmaps  

3. **Insight / AI Layer**  
   - Compute ratios like layoffs : hiring, growth rates  
   - Detect spikes or anomalies in layoffs/hiring  
   - Optionally, simple forecasting or trend projection  

4. **Dashboard Construction**  
   - Build interactive visuals: line charts, bar charts, filters by year / domain / geography  
   - Arrange into views: overview, comparison, trends  

5. **Interpretation & Insights**  
   - Narrative around what the trends mean: which years were hardest, which sectors recovered faster, etc.  
   - Suggest possible future movements or caution signals
